## I am currently on the job market!

Rabe Abdalkareem is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL) at Queen’s University, Canada, where he works under the supervision of Prof. Ahmed E. Hassan.

Prior to joining the SAIL lab, he was a research assistant in the DAS Lab at Concordia University. He obtained his Ph.D. in Software Engineering at Concordia University supervised by Dr. Emad Shihab and Dr. Juergen Rilling‎. He received his MSc. in Computer Science from Concordia University.

His research interests and expertise are in Software Engineering, with a special interest in Crowdsourcing in Software Engineering (e.,g. Stack Overflow and npm), Empirical Software Engineering, Mining Software Repositories, and Software Ecosystems. In particular, He leverages historical project data and applies Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Statistical Analysis techniques in order to better understand what and how software practitioners use the crowd and build techniques to help them effectively take advantage of these crowd resources.

## Research Interests
- Mining software engineering repositories
- Empirical software engineering
- Software evolution and maintenance
- Software reuse
- Crowd sourced software engineering
- Data-driven software engineering
- Software ecosystem
